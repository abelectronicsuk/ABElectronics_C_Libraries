 * demo-toggleled.c
 *
 *  Created on: 07 July 2015
 *
 *  	This demonstration shows how to use a button on pin 15 of bus 2 to toggle the output of an led connected to pin 11 of bus 1.
 *  	A 300R resistor should be connected in series with the LED and the IO Pi to limit the current.
 *
 *      compile with "gcc ../ABE_IoPi.c demo-toggleled.c -o demo-toggleled"
 *      run with "./demo-toggleled"
