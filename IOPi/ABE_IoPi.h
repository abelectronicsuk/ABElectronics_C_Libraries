 Each MCP23017 chip is split into two 8-bit ports.  port 0 controls
 pins 1 to 8 while port 1 controls pins 9 to 16.
 When writing to or reading from a port the least significant bit represents
 the lowest numbered pin on the selected port.

 Required package: libi2c-dev
 apt-get install libi2c-dev
