AB Electronics C Libraries
=====

C Libraries and demo code to work with Raspberry Pi expansion boards from http://www.abelectronics.co.uk

To download to your Raspberry Pi type in terminal: 

```
git clone https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_C_Libraries.git
```

### ADCDAC Pi
This library reads ADC inputs and writes to DAC outputs on the [ADC-DAC Pi Zero](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/74/ADC-DAC-Pi-Zero-Raspberry-Pi-ADC-and-DAC-expansion-board "ADC-DAC Pi Zero") and [ADC-DAC Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/kb/article/1053/adc-dac-pi "ADC-DAC Pi").

### ADC Differential Pi
This library reads input values from the [ADC Differential Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/65/ADC-Differential-Pi-Raspberry-Pi-Analogue-to-Digital-converter "ADC Differential Pi") and [Delta Sigma Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/14/Delta-Sigma-Pi "Delta Sigma Pi").

### ADC Pi
This library reads input values from the [ADC Pi Plus ](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/56/ADC-Pi-Plus---Raspberry-Pi-Analogue-to-Digital-converter "ADC Pi Plus"), [ADC Pi Zero](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/69/ADC-Pi-Zero-Raspberry-Pi-Analogue-to-Digital-converter "ADC Pi Zero") and [ADC Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/kb/article/1044/adc-pi "ADC Pi").


### IO Pi
This library reads and writes to the [IO Pi Plus](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/54/IO-Pi-Plus "IO Pi Plus"), [IO Pi Zero](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/71/IO-Pi-Zero "IO Pi Zero") and [IO Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/kb/article/1042/io-pi "IO Pi").

### RTC Pi
This library controls the clock and internal SRAM on the [RTC Pi Plus](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/52/RTC-Pi-Plus "RTC Pi Plus"), [RTC Pi Zero](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/70/RTC-Pi-Zero "RTC Pi Zero") and [RTC Pi](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/kb/article/1051/rtc-pi "RTC Pi")

### Servo Pi
This library controls the pwm outputs on the [Servo PWM Pi Zero](https://www.abelectronics.co.uk/p/72/Servo-PWM-Pi-Zero "Servo PWM Pi Zero").

We will be adding further C demos in the future for our boards.
