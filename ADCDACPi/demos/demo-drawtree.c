 *  	This demonstration uses an array of data points to draw a tree on an oscilloscope.
 *      The oscilloscope will need to be set into x-y mode with probes on channels 1 and 2 to display the picture.
 *
 *      compile with "gcc ../ABE_ADCDACPi.c demo-drawtree.c -o demo-drawtree"
 *      run with "./demo-drawtree"
