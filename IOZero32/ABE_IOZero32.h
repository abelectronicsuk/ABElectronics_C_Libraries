 ================================================
 AB Electronics UK IO Zero 32: 32-Channel Port Expander
 See CHANGELOG.md for the version number
 ================================================

 32-Channel Port Expander based on the PCA9535.
 The PCA9535 chip is split into two 8-bit ports.  Port 0 controls
 pins 1 to 8 while Port 1 controls pins 9 to 16.
 When writing to or reading from a bus or port the least significant bit
 represents the lowest numbered pin on the selected port.

 Required package: libi2c-dev
 apt-get install libi2c-dev
